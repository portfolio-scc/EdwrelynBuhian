                            Working in customer service has taught me more than just handling inquiries—it's shaped how I communicate, solve problems, and stay calm under pressure. From troubleshooting technical concerns to processing warranty claims, every interaction reinforces the importance of empathy and clarity. I've learned that patience goes a long way, and that sometimes, the best solution is simply listening first.

                            Serving as secretary for different organizations at SCC taught me that leadership isn't always about being in front. Sometimes it's about keeping things organized, documenting decisions, and making sure everyone's voice is heard. Being part of the Central Student Council, NSTP-NSRC, and SPACES allowed me to contribute meaningfully while learning from others. The recognition we received—like placing 3rd in Gawad Pawid—was a reminder that teamwork and consistency matter more than individual credit.

                            I never imagined I'd be hosting school events, but once I tried it, I realized how much I enjoyed it. Being an emcee isn't just about speaking—it's about reading the room, keeping energy up, and making people feel welcome. From year-end parties to general assemblies, each event helped me grow more confident and comfortable in front of an audience. It's become one of my favorite ways to contribute to campus life.

                            Juggling a full-time job and being a Computer Engineering student isn't easy, but it's taught me discipline and time management. Some days are exhausting, but knowing that I'm building both work experience and academic knowledge keeps me going. I've learned to prioritize what matters, ask for help when needed, and celebrate small wins. It's not about doing everything perfectly—it's about showing up and doing your best with what you have.
